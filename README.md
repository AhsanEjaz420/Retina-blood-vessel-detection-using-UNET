# Retina-blood-vessel-detection-using-UNET
This repository provides a dataset and deep learning implementation for detecting blood vessels in retina images. It includes retina images with corresponding mask images highlighting the vessels. A Jupyter notebook demonstrates the binary segmentation task, and pre-trained models in .pth format are available for use or fine-tuning.
